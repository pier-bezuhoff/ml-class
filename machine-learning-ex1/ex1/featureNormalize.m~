function [X_norm, mu, sigma] = featureNormalize(X)
  %FEATURENORMALIZE Normalizes the features in X 
  % FEATURENORMALIZE(X) returns a normalized version of X where
  % the mean value of each feature is 0 and the standard deviation
  % is 1. This is often a good preprocessing step to do when
  % working with learning algorithms.

  mu = mean(X);
  X_norm = X - repmat(mu, m, 1); % center each column
  sigma = scale = std(X);
  scale(scale == 0) = 1; % std = 0 => don't scale
  scale = diag(1 ./ scale);
  X_norm *= scale; % scale each column
